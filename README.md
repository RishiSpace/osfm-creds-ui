# OSFM Credentials Manager

OSFM Credentials Manager is a modern, open source, privacy-focused credentials manager built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows you to securely store, manage, and back up your sensitive credentials (API keys, SSH keys, GPG keys, passwords, and more) directly in your browser, with optional encrypted backup to your own Google Drive.

## Features

- **Local-First Security:**
  - All credentials are encrypted and stored locally in your browser using your master password. No data is sent to any external server.
- **Google Drive Backup:**
  - Optionally back up your encrypted credentials to your own Google Drive account. Restore them on any device, any time.
- **Multiple Credential Types:**
  - Store API keys, SSH keys, GPG keys, passwords, and other sensitive information.
- **Tagging & Search:**
  - Organize credentials with tags and quickly search/filter through them.
- **Import/Export:**
  - Securely import/export your credentials as encrypted files for easy migration or backup.
- **Dark/Light/AMOLED Themes:**
  - Beautiful, production-ready UI with full support for light, dark, and AMOLED black themes. Theme automatically adapts to your system preference.
- **Open Source & Auditable:**
  - 100% open source. Review, audit, and contribute to the codebase.
- **No Vendor Lock-in:**
  - Your data is always yours. Export or back up at any time.
